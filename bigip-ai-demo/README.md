## AI Powered BIG-IP for multi-cluster, multi-tenant Kubernetes/OpenShift based AI infrastructure with AI workloads.

This document discusses AI powered BIG-IP for customer centric usecases with multiple requirements.

The key areas that BIG-IP need AI intelligence are as follows:

* Dynamically offload crypto operations for optimal SSL/TLS processing

* Steer traffic based on AI insights (e.g., load, security, SLA adherence).

* Ensure SLA enforcement by intelligently prioritizing traffic.

* Enable AI-driven ingress/egress routing for seamless multi-cluster connectivity.

* Auto-scale services based on demand patterns detected via AI.

* Improve service discovery & orchestration with AI-based network optimization.

* Ensure service resilience with AI-powered cluster maintenance.

In this PoC we will use BIG-IP (Classic), AS3, CIS, AI Intelligent Network Optimization agent.
